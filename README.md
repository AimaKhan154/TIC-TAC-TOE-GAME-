# 🎮 MIPS Tic Tac Toe Game  

This project is a **Tic Tac Toe** game implemented in **MIPS Assembly Language**, showcasing low-level programming skills and game logic design. 🚀  

## 🕹️ Features  
- **3x3 Grid Representation:**  
  - Memory-efficient grid with clear values:  
    - `0`: Empty  
    - `1`: Player 1 (X)  
    - `2`: Player 2 (O)  
- **Dynamic Gameplay:**  
  - Alternating turns tracked via registers.  
  - Win or draw detection after every move.  
- **Robust Input Handling:**  
  - Validates player inputs to ensure seamless gameplay.
